### General Info
This project is a simple calender application which allows a user to save events for each hour of the day and the events are saved to the page. Users are able to see the current day date on top of the page, type into each text area associated with each hour, then save the task. The text area background changes thoughout the day as well. For the current hour, the text slot wil display a sky blue color. For times before, the color is more of a teal and any time in the future is a dark forest green. Once the user presses the save button which is located on the far right of each hour slot, the data or task is saved to the browser and will remain on the page regardless if the user reloads the page. The tasks are only removed if the user presses the reset button at the top of the calender or waits til the next day. 

This porject implemented moment.js for the date, jQuery and Javascript for functionality, and Bootstrap for overall layout. This project taught me how to use moment to display time and to grab data from the current time to change the text box background color. This project especially helped improve my understanding and skills using jQuery and to select certain data from localStorage. Some problems I encountered were mostly on localStoage and properly storing and retrieving data. This was solved by better understanding jQuery and using the correct methods to identify and retrieve data.  In the future, I hope to implement some more user friendly features such as using a data picker to select certain dates, have an option for users to view tasks on a monthly basis instead of daily, and improve some styling on the page. Thank you for checking out my calender application!
